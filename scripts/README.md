# Scripts

This [folder](.) is dedicated to scripts, whether `python`, `bash` or `sbatch`.

Generally, scripts are more for standalone processes or exploring things.

A good rule of thumb is, **if you are executing a python file directly with the python
executable in command line format, it belongs here**.

ex.

```python3 scripts/some_script.py```

Once a script is more mature, it should be generalized and integrated into the package
itself.
